# ASP.NET-Core-Practice
Useful practices for sending data from controller, getting data from views, Validation types. Worked on MVC design Pattern.

Topics in this practice ;

1- Worked in object types(Viewbag, ViewData, TempData)

2- Validations with ModelMetadataType 

3- Tuple objects posting to view (new Product(), new User()) 
    and getting from a user([Bind(Prefix = "item1")] )
    
4- ViewModel classes 

5- Getting data via header, I check this with postman app.

6- Used basic Ajax methods for posting an object.

7- Worked with Route Parameter and QueryString checked their differences.

8- Check the differences between taghelpers and html helpers.

9- Created some custom tag helpers. 

10- Worked on Model Bindings

These are all for practice and see the difference in between types.
