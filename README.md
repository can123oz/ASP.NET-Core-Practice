Useful practices for sending data from controller, getting data from views, Validation types. Worked on MVC design Pattern.

Topics in this practice ;

1- Worked in object types(Viewbag, ViewData, TempData)

2- Validations with ModelMetadataType

    and getting from a user([Bind(Prefix = "item1")] )
    
4- ViewModel classes 

5- Getting data via header, I check this with postman app.

6- Used basic Ajax methods for posting an object.
