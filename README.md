# ASP.NET-Core-Practice
Useful practices for sending data from controller, getting data from views, Validation types. Worked on MVC design Pattern.

Topics in this practice ;

1- Worked in object types(Viewbag, ViewData, TempData)

2- Validations with ModelMetadataType 

3- Tuple objects posting to view (new Product(), new User()) 
    and getting from a user([Bind(Prefix = "item1")] )
    
4- ViewModel classes 

5- Getting data via header, I check this with postman app.

6- Used basic Ajax methods for posting an object.

7- Worked with Route Parameter and QueryString checked their differences.

8- Check the differences between taghelpers and html helpers.

9- Created some custom tag helpers. 

10- Worked on Model Bindings

11- Add FluentValidation library on backend for better reusable codes.

12- We have to make validations both in fontend and backend with same credentials.
    Because if we dont make it at the frontend, the feedback will arrive to the user
    with the response. So its un efficient way of controlling data. Thats why we have
    to make controls in the Views layer and controller layer.

 

These are all for practices to see difference in between types and methods.
